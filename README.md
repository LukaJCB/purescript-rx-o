# purescript-rxjs
An un-opinionated PureScript wrapper for RxJS.


### Installation

```bash
npm install rxjs
```

I plan to package a release soon for bower/Pursuit.  Until then, you can include this library in you projects by adding the repo to your bower dependencies, like so:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
  // Other dependencies here,
   "purescript-rxjs": "git://github.com/jasonzoladz/purescript-rxjs.git"
 }
```
